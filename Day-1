 Day 1 of My DevOps Challenge – Linux Basics Unlocked! 🐧

I'm thrilled to kickstart my DevOps learning journey with Day 1 focused on Linux Basics – the foundation of every DevOps engineer’s toolkit. 💻

Today’s Highlights:
✅ Explored essential Linux commands (ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, etc.)
✅ Understood the Linux file system hierarchy
✅ Practiced creating and managing files and directories
✅ Got hands-on with user creation & permissions using chmod, chown, and adduser

This marks the beginning of my DevOps challenge, and I’m excited to document every step of my progress here.

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive into shell scripting, Git, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and beyond!
